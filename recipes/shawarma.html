        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish that originated in the 
            Ottoman Empire, consisting of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in an 
            inverted cone, and roasted on a slowly turning vertical rotisserie or
             spit. Traditionally made with lamb or mutton, it may also be made with 
             chicken, turkey, beef, or veal. Thin slices are shaved off the cooked 
             surface as it continuously rotates. Shawarma is a popular street food
              in the greater Middle East, including Lebanon, Egypt, Kuwait, Iraq, 
              and the Levant, also served widely in Saudi Arabia.</p1>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Marinade Instructions</h3>
            <li>Butterfly or pound your chicken thighs until they are 
                1/2 cm or 1/4 inch thick, even thickness is crucial for
                 a great cook. If you are using chicken breasts then 
                 butterfly them and then pound to an even thickness</li>
            <li>Crush your bay leaves using a pestle and mortar or a spice 
                grinder (you can use some of the salt to help with this),
                 then add to a bowl with the remaining spices</li>
            <li>Mince your garlic and mix with the Yoghurt, Tomato Paste, Lemon 
                Juice, Olive oil, white vinegar and the spice mix. Stir until well
                 mixed and then add your chicken in to the bowl and mix to ensure each
                  piece is well coated in the marinade</li>
            <li>Place your chicken in the fridge for a minimum of 12 hours so the marinade can really take effect</li>

            <h3>Chicken Shawarma</h3>
            <li>Slice your marinated chicken thighs into strips about 1/2 cm or 1/4 inch thick</li>
            <li>Using a skewer, pierce your chicken strips all along one side and slide them onto 
                the skewer until the entire chicken thigh has been threaded on to the skewer</li>
            <li>With a second skewer, pierce the opposite end of the chicken, so that the chicken 
                strips are suspended between both skewers, it will kind of resemble crochet. Push the
                 thigh together so it's slightly compressed then repeat until you have filled all 
                 your skewers. Leave about an inch clear on both tips of the skewer.</li>
            <li>Line a deep baking sheet with foil or dish with foil, then place the skewers across the 
                edge of the sheet. Either end of the skewer should be resting on opposing walls of the baking
                 sheet, with the meat suspended between them, floating above the sheet not sitting in it (you may
                  need to use a deep baking dish if your trays are shallow).</li>
            <li>Place your tray in the oven with your grill or broiler set to medium and cook for 3-5 minutes. Rotate
                 the skewers to the second side and cook for another 3-5 minutes. Place them back in the over for 2-3
                  more minutes until slightly charred. Cooking times will really vary with each broiler or 
                  grill, but you should basically flip when it starts to develop a sear then flip when it happens
                   on the other side. Your chicken should read 74c or 165f when done. If your broiler or grill only
                    has one strength setting, try rotating it more often such as every minute.</li>
            
            <h3>Pan Grilled Directions</h3>
            <li>Heat a grill pan or griddle and place a few chicken thighs in it, but don't overcrowd the pan</li>
            <li>Cook them on medium high heat, flipping them every 2-3 minutes until cooked through, this should only
                 take a few minutes</li>
            <li>Remove and let cool slightly before slicing into thin strips

            </li>
        </ol>
